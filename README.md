## Architecture
This project is divided into three layers of presentation, persistence, and actions or rules
is a common pattern. Some variations on this approach are so common, theyâ€™ve been
given names. Model-view-controller (MVC) is a way of modeling data for persistence,
providing users with a view into that data, and allowing them to control changes to
that data with some set of actions.

## Technologies
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
 - [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
 - [Github](https://github.com/)
 - [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)
 - [Apscheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Constraints
 -  The app runs in only one instance which is set by '--noreload flag'.
    It keeps Django from starting up a second instance which is the default behavior in debug mode. 
    A second instance would mean all scheduled tasks would fire twice.
 -  The app reads data from a local file to stimulate actual data due to the restriction placed on host country on twitter.
    The [fetch_tweet_csv](core/utils/process_csv.py) function can easily be modified to fetch real time data from twitter easily
